# Machine Learning for Wet Lab Researchers
## Premise

> It is difficult to think of a major industry that AI will not transform... There are surprisingly clear paths for AI to make a big difference in all of these industries - Andrew Ng

Artificial intelligence is at the core of the current-day paradigm for research and innovation. **Therefore, to understand and engage with modern research, researchers must embrace the advent of AI and learn how to effectively employ it.**

Machine learning (ML) is of pertinent interest in scientific research due to its ability to innovate the vast amount of data produced in the field. However, the computation behind these methodologies often appear inaccessible and intimidating for scientists with minimal exposure to such algorithms.

*This project seeks to provide a foundational overview of the applications of ML for researchers seeking to innovate their data analysis.*
