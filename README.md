# Machine Learning for Researchers
## Premise

> It is difficult to think of a major industry that AI will not transform... There are surprisingly clear paths for AI to make a big difference in all of these industries - Andrew Ng

Artificial intelligence is at the core of the current-day paradigm for research and innovation. **Therefore, to understand and engage with modern research, researchers must embrace the advent of AI and learn how to effectively employ it.**

*This project seeks to provide a foundational overview of the applications of AI for researchers seeking to innovate their data analysis.*
